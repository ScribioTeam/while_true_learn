ShortStoreDescription;You’re a machine learning specialist who makes neural networks but your cat seems to be better at it. Now you must solve puzzles to build a cat-to-human translation system (who knows what else this cat is capable of!). Earn a fortune, buy kickass cat outfits and learn how machine learning really works!;Vous êtes un specialiste en apprentissage automatique qui fabrique des réseaux neuronaux mais votre chat semble y arriver mieux que vous. Vous devez maintenant résoudre des puzzles pour concevoir un système de traduction chat vers humain (qui sait de quoi ce chat est encore capable !). Gagnez un tas d'argent, achetez des tenues de chats et apprenez comment marche vraiment l'apprentissage automatique !
FullStoreDescription;"[b]IMPORTANT NOTE[/b] Please take a look at the Early Access section, you'll find future plans, current state description and a story behind the game.\n[h2][b]ABOUT THE GAME[/b][/h2]\n\n[b]while True: learn()[/b] is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat.\n\nIn this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.\n\n[h2][b]Learn how machine learning works in real life[/b][/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/g_learn.png[/img]\nThe game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required`\n\n[h2][b]Train yourself into a data science wizard! [/b][/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/g_build.png[/img]\nDrag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.\n[h2][b]Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! [/b][/h2]\n\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/g_tree.png[/img]\nDesigning a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do!\n\n\n[h2][b]Coding just got real![/b][/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/g_startup.png[/img]\nOur quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?\n\n[h2][b]Improve your gear, improve your life![/b][/h2]\n[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/g_catshop.png[/img]\nOnce you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!\n\n[b]Fun fact:[/b] this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!";

NEWSPAPER DEEP BODY;There are neural networks that solve the so-called “xor problem” (an unsolvable problem for Rosenblatt's perceptron). They have one “hidden” layer between the input and output layers. Such networks are called “non-deep”. \n \n If the network has more than one hidden layer, it is called “deep”. The deeper the network, the more complex dependencies it is able to recognize. For example, the current image recognition networks include several thousand hidden layers. Amazing, isn't it?;

NEWSPAPER NEURON TYPE BODY;"In neural nets, programmers use a vast range of different neurons. Inside each neuron, a math function is located.\n\nFor example, Rosenblatt's neuron used a linear function. Simple neural net, which can solve ""xor problem"", uses ""relu"" function.\n\nThese functions are called ""activators"". For different tasks people use different activators which will be more suitable for certain cases. To solve more difficult issues, a combination of neurons with different activators is used.";

I dream of producing the goods that would be both of high quality and exquistely tasty! And they simply can't be made without high accuracy in fermentation processes. Alright, off with those fancy words. I want to teach a program to be able to tell the quality of a product judging on its ingredients. This way we will get able to separate tasty and well-made products from bad ones. We often make mistakes when doing it manually, and a lot of our products never leave the factory since we mark them as defective ones. We have the data, but we need a program. ;

Long story short, we're looking for ways to improve the quality of pictures in order to be able to see even the smallest details. But we're kind of stuck as our program is just not good enough to recognize certain silhouettes. We would also like to improve the color restoration system, and combine those two, so they could work together. Can you help us out?;

EXPERT SYSTEM NEWS;1965 can be considered a peculiar starting point for the work on the creation of expert systems. In that year, scientists from the Stanford Research Institute, Edward Feigenbaum and Bruce Buchanan, teamed up with Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg and began to create a computer system, designed to determine the molecular structure of chemical compounds.;

The first ideas of creating Decision trees date back to the works of Hoveland and Hunt in the late 50s of the 20th century. However, the fundamental work that gave impetus to the development of this direction was the book Hunt, Marin and Stone Experiments in Induction, which was published in 1966.;

LOWGRAD_TITLE;Vanishing gradient;
LOWGRAD_BODY;The problem of 'Vanishing gradient' is a big problem in the process of training deep neural networks, especially recurrent neural ones. Passing through a number of layers of the network, the gradient becomes so small that it stops changing the weights of the network and the network stops learning. \n\nThere are several ways to solve this problem. One of those is using shortcuts (Gates) to pull the gradient through the network layer. \n\nAs a result of applying this method, the LSTM layer (Long Short Term Memory) was made, which allows realizing short-term and long-term memory of the network.;

ELEMS_HIER1;Recognizing objects;
ELEMENT_HIRE_TEXT1;In <color=#ffbd18>reinforcement learning</color> tasks, nodes work in a bit different way\n\n All data is initially unspecified and your task is to recognize it and transmit it to RL Agent (the AI);
ELEMS_HIER2;Elements hierarchy;
ELEMENT_HIRE_TEXT2;Nodes distinguish one or more types of data, and also process them in different ways. Type, correlation and quality of the data that will be received by the model of the machine are what its learning process and the data procession result are depending on. ;
ELEMS_HIER3;Data quality;
ELEMENT_HIRE_TEXT3;Some types of data are complex, and simple nodes cannot accurately recognize what they are but are able to refer them to a generalized group. To determine the exact classes, you will need to use more complex nodes \n\nRemember that it is not always advantageous to recognize objects in as much detail as possible;
MEETML1;Training model;
MEETML_TEXT1;At this screen you will be testing your AI\n\nAI acts based on the data you've been recognizing when building your scheme;
MEETML2;Training and testing;
MEETML_TEXT2;Here you can see the training, test and release runs \n\nTrain your car, test it and release it!;
MEETML3;Learning options;
MEETML_TEXT3;All possible behavior patterns of your car are the 'specimen' (or, in terms of machine learning, 'solutions') of your 'population'\n\nIn this section you can set up parameters of the 'population'\n\nThere are only 2 of them for now, but you'll see more in next levels;
MEETML4;Supervised run;
MEETML_TEXT4;At this stage you can teach the AI to recognize objects but this is not proper machine learning yet\n\nThis is why, having created a scheme, you can manually train your AI to drive\n\nUse WASD or arrow keys to drive and AI will try to reenact your moves afterwards;
MEETML5;Driving a car;
MEETML_TEXT5;Here you can see how AI controls the car\n\nGreen zone in the front (called 'Lidar') shows what your AI 'sees' \n\nInformation about obstacles comes from your recognizing algorithm. Without this data AI will be virtually blind and won't be able to tell one object from another\n\nOn the right you can see the AI's decisions visualized;
GENETIC_POPSIZE1;Population and selection;
GENETIC_POPSIZE_TEXT1;Each iteration of learning (an 'epoch') contains several  solutions (regulated by 'population size' parameter)\n\nAt the end of an epoch only the best solutions get to survive and multiply ('selection percentile' parameter);
GENETIC_POPSIZE0;Genetic algorithm;
GENETIC_POPSIZE_TEXT0;"Genetic algorithm is a subcategory of supervised learning method\n\nIt works pretty much like natural selection does in real life\n\nThe 'species' cross-breed, multiply and mutate: in theory, after many iterations this could give birth to the perfect ""specimen"" (or so we hope)";
GENETIC_POPSIZE2;Starting generation;
GENETIC_POPSIZE_TEXT2;Genetic algorithm is not too stable (pretty much like natural selection)\n\nSo if you feel that your car is not making much progress, you can try to generate a new population\n\nJust make sure to not overuse this feature;
GENETIC_MUT;Mutations;
GENETIC_MUT_TEXT;At the end of an epoch solutions can mutate. The probability of this is regulated by 'species mutation probability' parameter\n\nWhen a solution mutates, several 'genes' from its 'chromosomes' are selected and altered\n\nThis process is regulated by 'gene mutation probability' parameter;

FORUM_MESSAGE1_1;Hey everyone, can you believe my cat? That little devil has debugged my code. Again. He definitely has something to say, so I decided to make some sort of… err… device which would help me understand him? Give me advice, wish me luck maybe?\n\nP.S. I’m not insane, my mom had me tested.;
FORUM_MESSAGE1_2;Don’t rush ahead of yourself: making a device that would be able to detect the cat would be a nice start. You can work with video, sounds etc. when the time is right;
FORUM_MESSAGE1_3;Heyyyy, a couple of days ago I’ve been reading about how <color=#f05f4a>expert system</color> can be applied for detecting animals and writing chat bots! The newspaper was called <color=#f05f4a>Deep News</color>, I’ll be sending you my copies once I’m done with them.;
FORUM_MESSAGE2_1;Hey is there any way to detect the cat WITHOUT using expert systems? It works for texts but with pictures... Not so much. Furthermore, that cat just wont sit still :(;
FORUM_MESSAGE2_2;That it does (not)... Try decision trees then! Those are like expert systems but on steroids. Once you feel comfortable around them, try SIFT: this little devil is way more effective with pictures. Also works nicely when paired with other algorithms!;
FORUM_MESSAGE2_3;or u can use nails or glue or smth... cmon is just a cat it wont fight u back .. ijk pls dont use anythin I mentioned on an actual cat;
FORUM_MESSAGE3_1;heya, so I’ve managed to make my computer detect the cat. but that beast is a complicated soul, it definitely has more to tell. maybe it's time to go next level and start recognizing emotions...;
FORUM_MESSAGE3_2;ever heard of perceptrons? they were invented in the 60s to recognize written text. everyone knows that everything invented in the sixties is awesome by default: the double helix, rocknroll, lava lamps!;
FORUM_MESSAGE3_3;also you can maybe switch to dogs instead of cats? decision trees worked like a magic for my Pluto! Only you need to use multiple trees… like a forest (that's why it's called 'random forest' duh);
FORUM_MESSAGE4_1;okay, Ima out of ideas. half a time the cat’s emotion is recognized as ‘proud & classy’ it’s the time my cat is usually licking unspeakable parts of its body… I guess it feels real classy while doing so, but what if im wrong?;
FORUM_MESSAGE4_2;Try the genetic algorithm, genes rule! Wait, or was it ‘gin’? Or maybe a ‘genie’... Gotta check it out;
FORUM_MESSAGE4_3;Genetic algorithm is the answer! but you’d need multiple cats to properly train it.;
FORUM_MESSAGE4_4;geez u guys are so stuck in the 80s. @Player come back when you sick of waiting for millions of years while natural selection works its magic. Worked with carbon-based lifeforms, didnt it?;
FORUM_MESSAGE5_1;Gotta admit @DrCoder was probly right: this genetic algorithm is just too clumsy. especially now, when I'm starting to work with speech recognition...;
FORUM_MESSAGE5_2;hey cmon, you haven’t even waited for a year! have some respect towards the Natural Selection, why don’t you!;
FORUM_MESSAGE5_3;yeah, they've made a lot of improvements to perceptrons since old man Rosenblatt was around... now they tend to join multiple perceptrons in big bad neural networks. something like that could work for you but don't forget gradient descent: it's like a life coach for your 'neurons', helps them keep on the right track;
FORUM_MESSAGE6_1;Not sure if I’m on the verge of a breakthru or completely stuck. The cat talks! But all I'm getting seems to be a random set of words... Is there a way to get at least one-two sentences out of it?;
FORUM_MESSAGE6_2;Chill out. The Internet has taught you well, now is the time for ultimate trial! Try deep neural networks (ARMA, RNN etc.), they work good with speech, emotions and predicting things like that. Should work;

FORUM_MESSAGE1_4;Hey again, I’ve tried that expert system and it hardly makes any sense… Squares are floating from left to right, is that what’s the fuzz is all about the machine learning? Are you guys actually working there?;
FORUM_MESSAGE1_5;This is called ‘visual programming’, my fellow dude! Yes, this is how it’s supposed to work: the expert system analyzes your data input (from the camera) and checks if there’s a cat on them. No, it’s not what machine learning is all about, it will get to hardcore soon enough!;

We're living on a subarctic island in which we see a potential for turning into a luxurious spa resort (this is a second project of our company). Unfortunately, our location implies a rather cranky weather: it changes each 15 minutes from ice storms, to thunderstorms. People sometimes get blown off the island or get nasty frostbites... No serious injuries yet, but it complicates the marketing of an aspiring spa resort drastically!\n\nThat said, we need an algorithm which would be able to predict weather's next twist based on meteorological parameters. If we are able to predict it, we would be able to recommend our island's dwellers proper measures to cope with nature's surprises.
